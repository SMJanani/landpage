        <pre id="first">            Kazi Nazrul Islam is the national poet of Bangladesh who is
            especially recognized as a Bidrohi Kobi (rebel poet) around the
            country. Nazrul is a famous poet, musician and philosopher of
            Bangladesh. The famous poet Nazrul's writings deal with the
            revolution of that period of the British government. His
            revolutionary attempt helped him to be a national poet of
            Bangladesh. He has raised his voice against any kinds of fascism and
            oppression and got popularity swiftly around the Indian
            Subcontinent.</pre>


        <h3 id="name1">Awesome writer</h3>
        <pre id="second">           Nazrul's writings explored themes such as love, freedom, humanity.
            and revolution. He opposed all forms of bigotry and
            fundamentalism, including religious, caste-based and gender-based.
            Throughout his career, Nazrul wrote short stories, novels, and
            essays but is best known for his songs and poems. He pioneered new
            music forms such as Bengali ghazals. Nazrul wrote and composed
            music for nearly 4,000 songs (many recorded on HMV and
            gramophone records), collectively known as Nazrul Geeti.</pre>
